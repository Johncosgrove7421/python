# built-in Functions

Each module is a Python program that contains a related groups of functions that can used your program 

import statement

ex. import random 
then you can run random.randint ()  


import sys
then you can add the sys.exit() module to exit the program

ex program: 

import sys
print('Hello')
sys.exit() #This is used to exit the program
print('Goodbye') #This will never run with the sys.exit()



Third-Party module
you will install theses with pip

- You can import modules and get access to new functions 
- The modules that come with Python are called the standard library, but you can also install third-party modules using the pip tool
- The sys.exit() function will immediately quit your program
- The paperclip third-party module has copy() and paste() functions for reading and writing text to the clipboard

third-party module:
import pyperclip
pyperclip.copy('Hello world')
pyperclip.paste()
the output = Hello world


## Writing your own functions

Function = Mini-program in the program

It contains code that executes when the function is called
Just like your program contains code that executes when the program is run

Pythontutor.com has visual tools 

example making your own functions 


def hello():
    print('Hello')
    print('Hi')
    print('How are you?')

hello()
hello()
hello()
